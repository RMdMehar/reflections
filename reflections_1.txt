What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Manually committing versions helps us create logical checkpoints to our
    program and makes it easier to view and understand changes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    This is because the commits refer to changes in functionality of the same
    program, the different files may be interrelated.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log helps us in looking the entire commit history of the programmer
    git diff helps us in comparing two files, i.e, two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can easily undo my changes with the help of version control, I can find
    bugs easily and repair them
